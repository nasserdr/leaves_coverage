# Scikit-image Tutorial with an application on the calculation of plant leaves areas from digital images

This repository serves two purposes:
- A tutorial to learn scikit-image, a widely used python library for image processing.
- Examples on using this library (along with other techniques) in a practical case. Here, we treat the case of computing areas of leaves in plants using some scikit-image functions as well as other techniques.


## Files:
- skimage_examples.ipynb: A fully fledged introductory course in image processing using scikit-image.
- leaves_areas.ipynb: computing leaves areas: the code to compute the leaves areas.

## Data:
- Data consists on few leaves areas as well as building and faces (for educational examples).
